## In this project I used:
* `Sweetalert2` - for displaying alerts in more pleasing way.
* `date-fns` - for more complex operations with Dates.
* Pure CSS - no frameworks, nor preprocessors.

### The most interesting thing about this project is, that you can store your projects in browser memory, so even after reload or closing down your browser, they are still gonna be there. 

### To obtain this effect I used `localStorage`, which is simple alternative for small projects like this - so you don't have to use more complex databases.
